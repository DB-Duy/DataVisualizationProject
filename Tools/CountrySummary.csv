","The Nordic island nation of Iceland occupies an area of 103,000 km2 (40,000 sq miles) in the North Atlantic Ocean. The island owes its existence to a large volcanic fissure in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the Eurasian and Americantectonic platesmeet. Even today, the country is growing by about 5 cm per year, as itsplits wider at the points where two tectonic plates meet.Iceland is largely an arctic desert punctuated by mountains, glaciers, geysers, hot springs, volcanoes, and waterfalls.Most of the vegetation and agricultural areas are in the lowlands close to the coastline.As can be observed on the physical map of Iceland, the country's most distinctive features are the glaciers that cover over 4,600 sq. mi (11,922 sq. km) or 11. 5% of the total area of the country. During the past few decades, however, they've markedly thinned and retreated owing to a milder climate.By far thelargest of the glaciers is the Vatnajokullin southeast Iceland, with an area of 3,240 sq. mi (8,400 sq. km). The Vatnajokull glacier is equal in size to all the glaciers on the European mainland put together and reaches a thickness of 3000 ft. (1 km).The highest point in Iceland is Hvannadalshnukur, a peak on the edge of the Öræfajökull Volcano, which rises6,922 feet (2,110 m). The location of this point have been marked on the map by a yellow upright triangle.And speaking of Volcanoes, on March 21, 2010, the Eyjafjallajökull Volcano in southern Iceland erupted for the first time since 1821, forcing 600 people to flee their homes. Further eruptions in April forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes. And in fact, the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across Europe.Due to its stunning geographical features including mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, volcanoes and the pristine environment,Iceland is a great tourist destination for nature lovers.

Of these islands, the larger islands of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan (which comprises two-thirds of the island of Borneo), Sulawesi, and Irian Jaya are quite mountainous, with some peaks reaching 12,000 ft. These mountains on the major Indonesian Islands are densely forested and volcanic in origin. The mountains with the highest elevations (over 16,000 ft) are found on Irian Jaya in the east.Located in the Papua province and as a part of the Sudirman mountain range is Puncak Jaya – the highest point in Indonesia. At an elevation of 16,502 ft. (5,030 m) Puncak Jaya is also the world’s highest island peak and the Southwestern Pacific’s tallest mountain. The lowest point is the Indian Ocean (0m). Indonesia's former tallest peak, Mount Tambora (8,930 ft, 2,722 m), is an active stratovolcano whose 1815 eruption was the largest ever in recorded history - killing nearly 71,000 people. The explosion alone was heard as far west as Sumatra island, some 1,200 miles (2,000 km) away, and ashfalls were recorded on the islands of Borneo, Sulawesi, Java, and Maluku.In addition to the mountainous landscape, much of the islands as observed on the map, are covered in thick tropical rainforests that give way to coastal plains. The significant rivers of Indonesia include the Barito, Digul, Hari, Kampar, Kapuas, Kayan, and Musi. There are also some scattered inland lakes as well which are relatively small in size.Due to its location along the south-western arm of the Ring of Fire, Indonesia has about 400 volcanoes within its borders, with at least 90 still active in some way. The most active volcanoes are Mount Kelud (which has erupted more than 30 times since 1000 AD) and Mount Merapi (which has erupted more than 80 times since 1000 AD) on Java island. For its location between numerous tectonic plates, including the two continental plates: the Eurasian Plate (Sunda Shelf) and the Australian Plate (Sahul Shelf), and two oceanic plates: the Philippine Sea Plate and Pacific Plate; natural disasters are common in Indonesia.The most notable natural disaster is the 9.2 earthquake that struck in the Indian Ocean and which triggered the Tsunami of December 2004 and devastated many of the islands within Indonesia's archipelago.

Further north from the Tunisian Dorsal, the mountains of the Northern Tell (that include the Kroumirie Mountains in the northwest and the Mogods running along the northern coastline) can be found.In between the Tunisian Dorsal and Northern Tell Mountains lies the Medjerda River valley (shown on the map above). This valley features a series of ancient lake basins and is the country's most fertile grain-producing land. The Medjerda River is the only perennial river in Tunisia and its drains into the Gulf of Tunis.The High Steppes (in the west) and Low Steppes (in the east) lie to the south of the Tunisian Dorsale. They are cut by mountains running north to south.As we go further south, there is a series of depressions called chott. Many intermittent rivers flowing through the country end up in these chotts.Extending inwards from the eastern coastline are large plains called Al-Sāḥil and Al-Jifāra.Most of the southern part of the country is a sandy desert and much of it is part of the Sahara Desert's Sand Sea, also called the Grand Erg Oriental. Most of the wadis here remain dry all year round and hence, access to water is a major concern here.Tunisia also has several islands. The Djerba Island marked on the map above is North Africa's largest island. It is located in the  Gulf of Gabès.Mount Chambi (1,544 M) is the highest point in the country. At 17 m below sea level, Chott el Djerid is Tunisia's lowest point.

Offshore islands include Iles du Salut (and Devil's Island).As observed on the map, French Guinea is a land of rivers – many of them, flowing north from the southern mountains. The major ones include the Maroni and Lawa, forming its (disputed) border with Suriname; the Oyapok, forming a long natural border with Brazil, and the Approuaque, Camopi, Mana, and Tompok Rivers. The Barrage de Petit-Saut hydroelectric dam in the far north eventually formed a large artificial lake to the northeast of St Elie.The land of French Guiana begins to gently rise in the central regions of the country, ending at the base of the Tumac-Humac Mountains, along its southern border with Brazil. The highest point in French Guiana, as marked by an upright yellow triangle is, Bellevue de l’lnini, which rises to an elevation of 2,792 ft. (851m). The lowest point is the Atlantic Ocean (0m).

","Covering a total land area of 4,167 sq.km (1,609 sq mi) and spread over a vast area about the size of Europe, the widely scattered 118 islands and atolls of French Polynesia is an overseas collectivity of France and are divided into 5 island groups: theAustral, Gambier, Marquesas, SocietyandTuamotuarchipelagos; in the south-central Pacific Ocean. These island groups can be seen on the physical map of French Polynesia above.Scattered over 965,255 sq. miles (2,500,000 sq.km) of ocean, most of the islands of French Polynesia are volcanic in origin and fringed by coral reefs.  Of these islands, the Society archipelago is certainly the most famous. It includes the stunning islands of Bora Bora, Moorea and Tahiti – and like the enchanting Marquesas in the northeast – most are lush, dark green specs of land, volcanic in origin, with jagged-edged peaks jutting boldly into the sky. The tuamotu archipelago (in contrast to the other groups) includes only low-lying coral atolls (78 in all), and of these, only a handful have passable inlets into their central lagoons. Rangiroa, the largest coral atoll in French Polynesia, is famed for its natural beauty, and remains a favorite of travellers from across the globe. The Austral and Gambier islands in the south are lightly populated, as most are still uninhabited. The highest point of French Polynesia is Mont Orohena, which peaks at an elevation of 7,352 ft (2,241m). the lowest point is the Pacific Ocean (0m).

","Covering an area of 2,166,086 sq. km (836,330 sq mi), Greenland (about 80% of which is ice-covered) is the world’s largest (non-continent) island, located between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.As observed on the physical map of Greenland above, the coastline is rugged, mountainous, and for the most part, barren. The land then rises to a sloping icecap that covers (81%) most of the island. In places that ice has been measured at more than 11,000ft (3,350m) thick, countless (mostly small) rocky islands ring the coastline central to south, and much like Norway, fjords are plentiful.Some scientists have claimed that the Greenland ice sheet may actually conceal three large separate island land masses that have been bridged by glaciers since the last ice age. In 2002, as the ice in the far north began to melt, it left a small island exposed to daylight. Additional islands are expected to be discovered if that melting trend continues.There are nearly 40 glaciers covering the Greenland landmass, and one of the largest is the Peterman. Recently, a chunk of ice broke off the Peterman; an area of ice 100 sq. miles and 600ft thick. It is now drifting in a remote area called the Nares Strait between Greenland and Canada.Mountain ranges, either partly or totally buried by ice, fringe the toothy-edged coast. Greenland's highest mountains are the massive ice-covered peaks and exposed cliffs of the Watkins Range that run along it’s eastern coastline. The island's highest point is located there: Gunnbjorn’s Fjeld at 3,700m (12,139 ft). A yellow triangle marks its position on the map.Believe it, or not, hot springs are a common natural phenomenon in Greenland. In the far south on Uunartoq Island, they're warm enough to swim in. On Disko Island in the far-west, there are thousands of small hot springs.There are about 20 rivers in Greenland. All ring the coastline and all are small melt water outflows from a nearby glacier on the Greenland ice sheet. There are scattered small (summer lakes) across Greenland, all the result of glacier melt. These lakes drain away quickly, or freeze solid in the winter months.
